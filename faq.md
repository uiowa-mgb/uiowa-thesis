# Frequently asked questions

## Can I change the margins?
Sure! Just consult the requirements and keep in mind that long lines of text are
harder to read.

At the end of the day it's your thesis however; add the lines:
```latex
\setlrmarginsandblock{1in}{1in}{*}
\checkandfixthelayout 
```
in the preamble (before `\begin{document}`) your thesis will have 1in margins.
Change 1in to your preferred margins.
