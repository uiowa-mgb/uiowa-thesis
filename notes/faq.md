# Frequently asked questions

## Can I change the margins?
Sure! Just consult the requirements and keep in mind that long lines of text are
harder to read.

At the end of the day it's your thesis however; add the lines:
```latex
\setlrmarginsandblock{1in}{1in}{*}
\checkandfixthelayout 
```
in the preamble (before `\begin{document}`) your thesis will have 1in margins.
Change 1in to your preferred margins.

## How do I change the settings for biblatex?

These need to be changed before calling `\documentclass`. This is done like
this:
```latex
\PassOptionsToPackage{maxbibnames=999,url=true}{biblatex}
\documentclass{uithesis}
```

## Sublime text is not rendering the bibliography

This does not work out of the box for some reason on windows. It appears that
sublime's LaTeXTools plugin does not support biber out of the box when using
miktex. The following steps help rectify the problem.
1. Ensure biber and latexmk are installed with the [miktex console](https://miktex.org/howto/miktex-console)
2. Install [strawberry perl](https://strawberryperl.com/) (May I suggest using something like [scoop](https://scoop.sh/))
3. In sublime text go to `Preferences > Package Settings > LaTeXTools >
   Settings -- User` there should be a line which says `"builder": "something
   or other"` change that line to say `"builder": "basic"` then change
   `"distro": "whatever"` to say `"distro": "texlive"`
If this doesn't work feel free to open an issue.
